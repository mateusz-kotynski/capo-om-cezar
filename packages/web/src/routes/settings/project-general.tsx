/**
 * Project settings → General: what THIS project is, and the few knobs that belong to the project
 * as a whole rather than to agents, worktrees or templates.
 *
 * It exists because every other section answers a narrow question and none of them answered the
 * broad one. Where is this checkout? Is its folder still there? How many of its tasks may run at
 * once? How do I get rid of it? Those last two lived only in the GLOBAL registry table — a row
 * in a list of every project, reached from the other settings area — which is a strange place to
 * go to act on the project you are already inside.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately NOT duplicated here: anything machine-wide (appearance, host
 * resources, accounts — the index's footer links to Global settings for those), and the section
 * list, which is the left nav on desktop and only renders as cards on small screens.
 *
 * Reuse over restatement: the folder row, the concurrency select, and the removal wording+dialog
 * are the same components the registry table uses. Two pages disagreeing about what "Remove"
 * does is exactly the failure this page could otherwise introduce.
 *
 * Split in two halves, because `CEZ_SINGLE_PROJECT=1` treats them differently. DESCRIBING the
 * project (folder, registry facts) stays true in every mode. MANAGING the registry — the
 * concurrency ceiling, Remove — is what single-project mode takes away: `PATCH`/`DELETE
 * /api/v1/projects/:id` both answer 409 there (server.ts), and `visibleSettingsSections` already
 * drops the whole global Projects section for the same reason. Rendering those two fields anyway
 * would offer a knob that can only fail, which is the opposite of what capabilities.ts asks for
 * ("the UI hides what the server says isn't there, and the matching endpoints refuse as defense
 * in depth").
